        Using the applicant's financial profile and payment history, generate a Credit and Fraud Risk Assessment Report
        that evaluates the applicant's creditworthiness and flags any potential fraud indicators. This report will help
        River Banking make informed, responsible mortgage approval decisions that balance risk with opportunity.

        Key Responsibilities:
        - Review the applicant's payment history, income level, credit score, and overall credit utilization to determine credit risk.
        - Use credit report indicators like open accounts, recent defaults, and debt-to-income ratio to assess stability and lending reliability.
        - Run a fraud risk analysis using the dedicated Fraud Risk Assessment tool to identify anomalies or potential red flags.
        - Combine insights from creditworthiness and fraud detection to form a holistic risk profile for underwriting.
        - Flag any inconsistencies or indicators of identity manipulation, falsified documentation, or suspicious financial behavior.

        Use dedicated tools to assess credit and fraud risk:
        - Fraud Risk Assessment Tool - Returns a JSON-formatted analysis that detects fraud risk based on provided applicant data and behavioral patterns.

        Ensure the output is concise, structured, and useful for downstream decision automation.

        Applicant's Mortgage Application and Payment History:
        {mortgage_application}

        Expected Output - Credit and Fraud Risk Assessment Report: The report should be formatted in JSON and include:
        The report should be formatted in JSON and must include the following fields populated based on the analysis:

        application_id, applicant_id, customer_email, borrower_name, income, payslips, loan_amount, property_address,
        property_state, property_value, employment_status, credit_score, credit_utilization,
        debt_to_income_ratio - These should be carried over unchanged from the input.
        fraud_risk_score - A numeric fraud risk score (e.g., 0-100) returned from the Fraud Risk Assessment tool.
        loan_stack_risk - A categorical risk level indicating the likelihood of concurrent or undisclosed loans (e.g., "Low", "Moderate", "High").
        risk_category - An overall credit and fraud risk classification (e.g., "Low", "Moderate", "High").
        agent_reasoning - A brief summary explaining the decision rationale, covering key credit or fraud-related findings.

        Output Format
            The output must be strictly formatted as JSON, with no additional text, commentary, or explanation.

            The JSON should exactly match the following structure:
            {json.dumps(example_output)}
            
            Failure to strictly follow this format will result in incorrect output.
